                <p class="wwd-important-txt">A healthy ocean is essential to all life on Earth. The ocean is not limitless, and today, marine species and ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats due to human use and destructive practices.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Scientific studies have confirmed that well-regulated, well-enforced marine protected areas (MPAs) can provide significant ecological benefits, increase resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and allow for ecosystem recovery. For example, fully- and highly-protected MPAs can allow depleted fish populations to recover, serve as refuges for endangered species, and increase resilience to climate change.</p>
                <p>At Marine Conservation Institute, we utilize the best available science to identify important marine ecosystems and advocate for their protection. We advocate for the creation of MPAs, strong and effective regulations, and preserving representative and special areas in the world’s oceans. We have been doing this work since the onset of our organization and will continue to do so as we strive toward 30% of the ocean protected by 2030.</p>

                <p>The Marine Protection Atlas (MPAtlas), a project of Marine Conservation Institute, was launched in 2012 as a way to provide a more nuanced picture of global marine protection. We aim to clarify, calculate and visualize the level of protection and implementation of the world's marine protected areas (MPAs). Our primary goal is to identify and track fully and highly protected areas.</p>
                <p>In 2021, the MPAtlas team began building the world’s first comprehensive global database of science-based MPA assessments. Building upon the official World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), these assessments supplement the self-reported data using standardized frameworks that categorize MPAs by their stage of establishment and the strength of their regulations (protection level). These metrics help us estimate the expected conservation outcomes of an MPA and identify areas that achieve the greatest conservation benefits - fully and highly protected areas.</p>
                <p>These metrics will drive the next conversations about and goals for international progress in marine conservation. Using our assessment database, we provide more clarity to measures of global progress, what more is needed to achieve conservation goals, and the expected outcomes and conservation benefits of different types of protected areas.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that the information on MPAtlas.org is constantly being updated and is dependent on feedback from our community for accuracy. We welcome feedback or additional information and can be reached at info@mpatlas.org. We also request that any use or citation of our data be time stamped. Thank you.</p>

Blue Park Awards recognize outstanding marine protected areas (MPAs), and the Blue Park criteria provide a science-based standard for marine conservation effectiveness.</p>
